Rokhlin lemma

- Problem ID: `rokhlin_lemma`
- Test Problem: no
- Submitter: Kim Morrison
- Notes: §109 of Knill's 'Some Fundamental Theorems in Mathematics' gives the classical automorphism form. This problem strengthens it by dropping invertibility. The conclusion uses forward images: every aperiodic measure-preserving transformation of a standard Borel probability space admits, for every height n and every ε > 0, a measurable base B such that B, T B, …, T^{n-1} B are pairwise disjoint with union of outer measure ≥ 1 - ε. Only the base B is required measurable by IsRokhlinTower; the forward-image floors need not be measurable. The [StandardBorelSpace Ω] hypothesis is essential: the countable-cocountable σ-algebra on ℝ with the integer-shift map x ↦ x + 1 is aperiodic and measure-preserving but admits no nontrivial Rokhlin towers (every cocountable base intersects its own shift; every countable base has zero-measure tower). Mathlib has MeasurePreserving, IsProbabilityMeasure, Function.periodicPts, Set.PairwiseDisjoint, and StandardBorelSpace, but no Rokhlin lemma. The Challenge ships four small helper defs (IsAperiodic, towerFloor, towerUnion, IsRokhlinTower).

- Informal solution: Apply the non-invertible Rokhlin lemma in its usual preimage form to obtain a measurable high-measure tower `V = ⋃ j < n, T^{-j} C`. Put `B = T^{-(n-1)} C`, which is measurable. For `k < n`, the forward floor satisfies `T^k B = T^k(Ω) ∩ T^{-(n-1-k)} C`, so the floors are pairwise disjoint and their union contains `T^{n-1}(Ω) ∩ V`. Every measurable superset of `T^{n-1}(Ω)` pulls back to `Ω`, so `T^{n-1}(Ω)` has full outer measure; subadditivity with the small complement of `V` gives the required lower bound.
