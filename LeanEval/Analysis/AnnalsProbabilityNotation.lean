# Notation for AnnalsChallenge

This file defines notation (mostly probability-theoretic) for the AnnalsChallenge project.

Ported verbatim from `AnnalsChallenge/Notation.lean` in
<https://github.com/ImperialCollegeLondon/AnnalsChallenge> (v1.0.0, `e32eb14`). It is a
trusted support module, not a benchmark problem: it contains no `sorry` and no
`@[eval_problem]` declarations. It is imported by `LeanEval.Analysis.RademacherEnfloType`
and `LeanEval.Analysis.SupremumOfSelectorProcesses`.

/-- Suppose `P : Measure Ω`, `X : Ω → E`:

`𝔼[X; P] = ∫ ω, ↑(X ω) ∂P`

is notation for the integral (expectation) of a function `X` with respect to the measure `P`. -/
macro "𝔼[" X:term "; " P:term "]" : term => `(∫ ω, ↑($X ω) ∂$P)

/-- Suppose `μ : Measure E`

`𝔼[t; X ∼ μ] = ∫ X; t ∂μ`

where `X` is a variable and `t` is a term (possibly) depending on `X`. In probability theory
this represents the expectation of a function of `X` when `X` has law `μ`. For example we
could write `𝔼[X ^ 2; X ∼ μ]` for the second moment of `μ`.
