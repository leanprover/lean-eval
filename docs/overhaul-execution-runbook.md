# LeanEval lifecycle overhaul execution runbook

Status: **active companion to the completion plan**  
Scope authority: [`overhaul-completion-plan.md`](overhaul-completion-plan.md)

## 1. Purpose

This runbook is the operational checklist for finishing the lifecycle overhaul.
It is intentionally updateable: check items off, replace stale current-state
values, and keep the next action obvious. Do not use it to add product scope.

Before acting, read the completion plan in full. If an old tracker, branch,
comment, or original-plan clause conflicts with it, the completion plan wins.

## 2. Starting posture

At adoption, the intended safe posture is:

- production intake disabled;
- staging general replay disabled except for bounded isolated work;
- production replay disabled;
- automatic publication disabled;
- public result-owner, maintainer, and model-identity gates disabled;
- the lifecycle-aware leaderboard live with problem statements visible; and
- no FC, disproof, or experimental-kernel work authorized.

Do not trust this paragraph as a live probe. Phase 1 re-verifies it read-only
and updates the current infrastructure inventory in place if necessary.

## 3. Execution rules

### 3.1 Work autonomously inside the allowlist

Repository implementation, tests, PRs, review fixes, merges, ordinary CI, and
automatic disabled-state deployments are autonomous in the repository family
listed in completion-plan section 11.

Standing maintainer authorization covers every remaining in-scope operation,
including infrastructure, credentials, protected environments, production
enablement, canonical data, issue-intake retirement, announcements, and
external non-PR mutations. Complete the applicable impact packet, preconditions,
tests, rollback, and post-change verification before acting; standing approval
does not make an unready operation ready. Do not turn a missing local login
into a permission question: prepare an operator handoff when authenticated
execution is required.

Parallelize independent repository work and use build time productively. Do not
sit polling one workflow while other in-scope tasks can advance.

### 3.2 Standing authorization and remaining stop conditions

Do not request repeated approval for an operation already covered by the
standing authorization in completion-plan section 11. The production-launch,
historical migration/replay, and issue-retirement packets remain mandatory
readiness gates; complete and review them without waiting for another
permission response.

Stop for exact maintainer approval only before:

- opening, updating, or merging a pull request in a repository outside the
  allowlist;
- posting a Zulip message or comment;
- posting a comment or review on another person's pull request; or
- expanding the completion-plan scope.

At any high-impact readiness gate, record the exact mutation, target, user
impact, immutable inputs, rollback, and read-only precondition. A fail-closed
capability disable or credential revocation may proceed immediately, but its
impact and verification requirements are not waived. Other rollback follows
the same rules as its forward change.

### 3.3 Keep changes reviewable

- One coherent purpose per PR.
- Do not mix feature enablement with cleanup or refactoring.
- Preserve unrelated work in dirty worktrees.
- Do not weaken security checks merely to make a smoke pass.
- Do not add a new framework when a bounded script or existing mechanism is
  sufficient.
- Merge only after required checks are green and review threads are resolved.

### 3.4 Record current state, not a narrative

- Check off the item and update the current identifier or state.
- Do not append run-by-run histories or incident prose.
- Keep GitHub run links in the PR or handoff message.
- Retain only canonical machine-readable inputs consumed by later phases.

## 4. Phase 0 — rebaseline and delete overgrowth

Goal: make the repositories describe only the approved remaining program.

- [x] Inventory every open PR, active workflow, remote branch, and relevant
      local worktree in the allowlisted repositories.
- [x] Confirm the already identified escaped external branches are absent and
      the stale LeanEval PRs are closed.
- [x] Review any uncommitted local cleanup attempt as an untrusted candidate
      diff. Keep useful pieces only after comparing them with current upstream.
- [x] Delete the persistent model-identity qualification harness, private
      qualification Workers, workflows, generated types, fixtures, tests, and
      rebuild/recovery instructions.
- [x] Delete experimental-kernel shadow smoke, Arena/Mathgraph assets,
      checker-series and corpus-promotion machinery, wire/attestation protocols,
      candidate adapters, and tests that exist only for them.
- [x] Remove exact-byte solution-export capture hooks that existed only to feed
      the removed experimental-kernel lane.
- [x] Retain the existing official Lean build and nanoda replay path, its
      generic checker identity/revision fields, and its focused tests.
- [x] Preserve source-bound agent sessions, authorization boundaries,
      idempotency, CAS conflict handling, and other generally useful security
      hardening.
- [x] Remove superseded run narratives, diagnostic artifacts, and tests whose
      only purpose is preserving those narratives.
- [x] Retain canonical replay inventories, final plans, exact toolchain/source
      maps, unavailable-candidate data, current rollback contracts, and current
      infrastructure identifiers.
- [x] Retain an older canonical input set only while a live execution profile
      references it; delete the whole linked set after replacement.
- [x] Rewrite the submissions tracker, rollout runbook, and infrastructure
      inventory to current state and remaining gates, without a chronology.
- [x] Run repository tests, typechecks, linters with zero warnings, workflow
      validation, action-pin audit, and all relevant dry-runs.
- [x] Merge the cleanup in coherent repository-local PRs.

Exit condition: no tracked instruction tells a future agent to implement FC,
disproofs, experimental kernels, or the persistent qualification harness.

## 5. Phase 1 — read-only disabled-state reconciliation

Goal: establish one exact safe baseline before launch work resumes.

### 5.1 Repositories and automation

- [x] Record the protected `main` commits at reconciliation and retain stable
      component checkpoints for later operational bindings.
- [x] List open PRs and cross-referenced work; close or classify stale overhaul
      PRs.
- [x] Confirm no unplanned workflow dispatch is queued or running.
- [x] Confirm required checks, protected branches, and immutable dispatch-tag
      protections match current operating needs.

The table records durable component checkpoints, not the moving tip of an
append-only repository. Later Results-only or State-only descendants do not
invalidate these bindings. Section 5.2 records the deployed runtime separately.

| Repository | Durable checkpoint | Protection state |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lean-eval` | Completion-plan and runbook checkpoint `59c0c18b2d14015589927b6e810386025c93ba4b` | Required `verify` |
| `lean-eval-submissions` | Retained-State binding `36e405e558be69d50e3093d3e188d24d6fc7cfa1`; protected main and replay packet `d26a3090a338358915cc94651ec7efddde71d241`; deployed production Worker `6e0aeb2b5c71fb857f09feff6172c4ee7bdfae08` | Required `verify` |
| `lean-eval-leaderboard` | Protected and deployed main `939d69c88292358adf60b124f29605215a1e422a` | Required `build`; exact Pages deployment and live readback complete |
| `lean-eval-state` | Retained-baseline checkpoint `76b3b3e54f4be69161a00cd81576a58df8eae815` | Required `validate`; append-only descendants allowed |
| `lean-eval-state-staging` | Launch-acceptance checkpoint `0849a95026ea3491ec55f1e0ef3b6ff2dff00fd5` | Required `validate`; append-only descendants allowed |
| `lean-eval-releases` | `7dba9bf4f78c71ff478de8c593cb41e07201c14a` | Required `validate` |
| `lean-eval-generator` | `010b01634cccda2db538cf9b09e6f26ddc453743` | Required `check` |
| `lean-eval-audit` | `d73132415738b0d82c99fd43f630804fe996e342` | Reviewed changes; non-rewritable linear history |

### 5.2 Deployed services

Production serves deployed submissions implementation
`6e0aeb2b5c71fb857f09feff6172c4ee7bdfae08` with durable intake and exactly
the approved lifecycle routes enabled; protected `main` is the
documentation-only replay-packet descendant
`d26a3090a338358915cc94651ec7efddde71d241`. Deployment, CI, readiness,
health, non-mutating authorization denial, and protected-State validation pass.
Staging intake and public lifecycle routes remain disabled, with its promotion
canary enabled. Model consolidation, publication opt-out, production promotion
canary, and general replay remain disabled.

The source-App admission repair, private replay stream transfer, and bound
start diagnostics are included in the launch commit. The exact post-repair
private replay canary is terminal accepted; its credential, artifact, and
temporary-executor cleanup readbacks pass. The post-launch replay packet is
bound at protected submissions `main`
`d26a3090a338358915cc94651ec7efddde71d241` to controller source
`6e0aeb2b5c71fb857f09feff6172c4ee7bdfae08`. At activation State checkpoint
`4fae55f7699e80d5b50314cf678bcf6caa020ad8`, the retained queues contained
161 public and 630 private queued entries. Both bounded sustained chains are
active with independent controller variables and concurrency groups. The
private non-replenishing proof is terminal accepted at protected State
`24bcb65c8849b95f569c8ee037503049c7fe568f`; its source-free artifact,
credential scrub, sandbox destruction, and temporary-executor deletion pass.
Current sustained private run `33826897577` passed its exact protected-main
entry gate.

Leaderboard commit `939d69c88292358adf60b124f29605215a1e422a` is protected and
deployed. The live submit entry directs users to the production service,
requires both read-only Apps, recommends scheduled release by default, and
retains the dated issue-intake fallback. A representative problem page retains
its visible statement.

Release-role trust and the automatic controller are live at releases checkpoint
`7dba9bf4f78c71ff478de8c593cb41e07201c14a`. The migrated archive checkpoint is
audit `d73132415738b0d82c99fd43f630804fe996e342`. The launch canary is terminal
and scheduled for `2026-11-02T03:50:01.002Z`; temporary source access is absent.
The server-primary entry is live. The overlap began
`2026-09-02T06:57:10Z`, so issue intake cannot close before
`2026-09-30T06:57:10Z` or before its separate notice and readiness gates pass.

- [x] Read staging and production intake health.
- [x] Read staging and production broker/replay health and current versions.
- [x] Verify production serves deployed implementation
      `6e0aeb2b5c71fb857f09feff6172c4ee7bdfae08` and reports durable intake plus
      exactly the approved lifecycle routes.
- [x] Verify general replay is disabled and historical replay-controller
      variables are present only for an active bounded lane.
- [x] Verify automatic publication remains live.
- [x] Verify the deployed launch Worker and its release, archive, and
      retained-State checkpoints form one coherent unit.

### 5.3 State, credentials, and presentation

- [x] Verify protected State heads and validation status.
- [x] Inventory credential names, owners, scopes, expiry, rotation, and
      revocation without exposing values.
- [x] Confirm production State contains no unexpected accepted server
      submission or due release work.
- [x] Confirm the live leaderboard root, group tabs, stable problem URLs,
      problem statements, and representative solution metadata.
- [x] Confirm the scheduled-release presentation deploys from reviewed main and
      the canonical live asset is byte-identical.
- [x] Verify leaderboard commit
      `939d69c88292358adf60b124f29605215a1e422a` is the exact live Pages
      deployment.

Exit condition: the coherent disabled baseline was captured before launch.
Section 5.2 now records the live launch posture; a future mismatch becomes a
separate repository fix or infrastructure correction under standing
authorization.

## 6. Phase 2 — repository launch preparation

These lanes can proceed in parallel after Phase 1.

### 6.1 No-DNS submission entry

- [x] Add `https://lean-lang.org/eval/submit/` to the leaderboard site.
- [x] Explain that authentication continues on the LeanEval Worker origin.
- [x] Link to the production `workers.dev` application.
- [x] Verify navigation, accessibility, mobile layout, and return path to the
      leaderboard.
- [x] Keep OAuth callback and session handling on the Worker origin.

### 6.2 Release and archive repository preparation

- [x] Reconfirm the exact staging release OIDC trust mismatch.
- [x] Prepare the smallest reviewed infrastructure patch or operator command;
      do not apply it yet.
- [x] Reconfirm the production archive Wrap-only role requirement and prove the
      desired policy excludes unwrap.
- [x] Verify the release controller reconstructs deterministically with
      publication disabled using credential-free fixtures.
- [x] Verify submitter-facing license, release delay, initial private choice,
      and irreversible later opt-in language.
- [x] Keep publication opt-out disabled and absent from user-facing forms and
      documentation.

### 6.3 Lifecycle API launch surface

- [x] Confirm feature flags exist independently for the route families being
      launched.
- [x] Keep model consolidation disabled or remove it.
- [x] Run all existing repository tests.
- [x] Prepare the bounded success and authorization/validation fixtures required
      by the completion plan for each launch route family:
  - [x] metadata backfill;
  - [x] repair/retraction request;
  - [x] maintainer decision;
  - [x] model alias/rename; and
  - [x] publication opt-in success, including post-result atomic scheduling.
- [x] Accept the green repository tests and retained prior bounded staging
      route evidence as the prelaunch evidence for backfill,
      repair/retraction, maintainer decisions, and model alias/rename. Do not
      run a fresh exact-f03 live matrix for those optional routes.
- [x] Move the required live publication-opt-in proof to the packet-bound
      production canary; keep its focused repository coverage green before
      launch.
- [x] Verify every launch gate can be returned to disabled and health reports
      the effective state.
- [x] Do not build a persistent staging harness.

### 6.4 Exact-version core lifecycle rehearsal

The operational-baseline table in section 5.1 records the current repository
family. The exact final-rehearsal staging basis was
`f03f5cde4f1ac83b13ce78f294fc2273980dbf0a`, with immutable tag
`lean-eval-dispatch/f03f5cde4f1ac83b13ce78f294fc2273980dbf0a`.
Protected CI, staging deployment, and promotion canary pass. Protected releases
commit `c0bcb97d87eeb17c0a2f1ef7e8bfc76502deb798` remains the credentialed,
publication-disabled staging reconstruction fixture qualified by section 7.
The bounded final core smoke, all-false restoration, validation, and fixture
cleanup are complete.
Launch restore commit `39b2e67f7583926a4f1d66b723b5d4cf4756dd32`
completed the production launch. Current deployed descendant
`6e0aeb2b5c71fb857f09feff6172c4ee7bdfae08` retains that contract and adds the
reviewed private-replay correction. Its production deployment and exact live
readbacks pass; later documentation-only commits do not by themselves redeploy
that runtime.

Historical private-image preparation is independent of the deployed staging
and production Worker. Its retained artifacts do not define the launch binding,
and the historical lane remains outside the completed launch gate.

- [x] Bind the exact final candidate commits across the repository family.
- [x] Use a synthetic private source repository owned for staging.
- [x] Move the final source fixture to a temporary, non-default fixture branch
      in private allowlisted `lean-eval-state-staging`.
- [x] Select the private staging fixture repository in both contents-read org
      App installations, preflight both Apps against that branch, use a
      runtime-unique tag, and remove the staging branch and tag after the
      terminal run. The separately tracked production canary uses its own
      fixture branch in the same private repository; Phase 4 owns its terminal
      branch and App-access cleanup.
- [x] Retain the exact secret-Gist proof because it binds the headless request
      to the individual GitHub login. Apply only the exact runtime-generated
      Gist file CAS write/restore under standing authorization.
- [x] Prepare one browser and one source-bound headless submission.
- [x] Retain repository coverage and prior bounded staging evidence for invalid
      and unauthorized optional-route cases.
- [x] Confirm archive-before-evaluation and schema-version-3 binding against
      the exact final candidate for both browser and headless submissions.
- [x] Confirm both exact-candidate core paths produce immutable Results and
      append-only State, including the initially scheduled headless release
      readiness and redacted projection.
- [x] Do not require an exact-f03 live matrix for metadata backfill,
      repair/retraction, maintainer decisions, model alias/rename, or
      publication opt-in. The production canary owns the live opt-in proof.
- [x] Prepare the rollback/disable steps for the same exact version.

Exit condition: repository changes and staging fixtures are ready; bounded
external mutations occur only at their exact runtime step.

## 7. Autonomous credential-boundary preparation

The staging boundary has been exercised with production and publication
authority absent:

- [x] Apply only the reviewed staging trust change.
- [x] Run one credentialed staging release unwrap and reconstruction.
- [x] Verify consume-before-unwrap and identical reuse refusal.
- [x] Remove AWS authority before reconstruction execution.
- [x] Verify source allowlist, no plaintext artifact, no State/Git mutation,
      and cleanup.
- [x] Confirm the one-use grant was consumed and workflow AWS credentials were
      cleared before reconstruction.

Complete the production **Wrap-only** connection autonomously while intake
remains disabled:

Current qualification: the immutable-tag production Wrap-only preflight
passes, including an actual synthetic Encrypt and an explicit Decrypt denial.

- [x] Connect repository environment
      `archive-production` variable `AWS_WRAP_ROLE_ARN` to
      `arn:aws:iam::161072922960:role/lean-eval-archive-wrap-production`.
- [x] Dispatch the immutable-tag preflight that encrypts a synthetic key for the
      exact production archive subject.
- [x] Require that same preflight to prove decrypt is denied.
- [x] Do not accept a production submission during this preflight.

Complete the isolated production release-role trust repair autonomously while
publication remains disabled:

At protected releases head
`7dba9bf4f78c71ff478de8c593cb41e07201c14a`, the release role trusts only the
exact ID-bearing production environment subject. The exact current-State
projection and write-free no-op preflight are protected, and
`PUBLICATION_ENABLED=true` after the successful no-due-work controller
qualification.

- [x] Change only the trust on
      `lean-eval-release-unwrap-invoker-production` from the obsolete name-only
      subject to
      `repo:leanprover@7233018/lean-eval-releases@1340741242:environment:release-production`.
- [x] Run the trust-only production preflight with `PUBLICATION_ENABLED` absent.
- [x] Confirm the preflight has no archive, State, Git, or artifact write path.
- [x] Keep `PUBLICATION_ENABLED` absent until the release-controller launch
      action; it is now enabled under Phase 4.

Exit condition: new production submissions can receive safe envelopes and the
release path has passed a credentialed staging boundary.

## 8. Phase 3 — final staging acceptance

The exact-f03 final acceptance is complete. It was limited to the browser and
source-bound headless core paths; optional lifecycle route families require no
new live matrix. Protected submissions commit
`f03f5cde4f1ac83b13ce78f294fc2273980dbf0a`, its immutable tag, staging
deployment, promotion canary, and both core paths pass. Staging intake and all
public lifecycle gates are false, model consolidation and publication opt-out
remain false, and the promotion canary is intentionally true. The watchdog is
cancelled, the temporary staging branch and tag are absent, and the exact
identity proof is restored. Protected releases commit
`c0bcb97d87eeb17c0a2f1ef7e8bfc76502deb798` remains the already qualified
publication-disabled staging reconstruction fixture.

- [x] Merge and deploy the exact final candidate through the normal protected
      path and qualify the corrected bounded-smoke workflow.
- [x] Reconcile the exact-f03 browser and source-bound headless submissions
      through archive-before-evaluation, terminal evaluation, immutable Result,
      append-only State, and release readiness where selected.
- [x] Run the all-false recovery and fixture cleanup; verify public-health
      readback, staging State validation, and absence of exposed source or
      credential material.

Do not rerun broad historical matrices merely to obtain newer timestamps.

## 9. Production launch readiness gate

Prepare the compact launch readiness packet specified by completion-plan
section 7.5.

Standing authorization for these operations is recorded in completion-plan
section 11. Before packet `GO`, confirm that it binds these launch components
as separate planned actions:

- [x] automatic release controller enablement and readback;
- [x] approved public lifecycle API enablement and readback;
- [x] production intake enablement plus one named production canary with
      permanent archive, Result, State, and release-schedule records; and
- [x] the exact overlap-announcement requirements and separately gated launch
      copy.

Do not launch until every prelaunch packet item and precondition is satisfied.
The packet's explicitly identified post-action finalization fields remain open
at `GO` and are filled after each corresponding Phase 4 action. Standing
authorization removes another permission interruption; it does not allow a
green staging run to substitute for launch readiness.

The compact launch packet is protected in submissions migration head
`7050f0e100323070375bc58c3510ec322cfcce1e`. The reviewed launch restore is
`39b2e67f7583926a4f1d66b723b5d4cf4756dd32`; deployed descendant
`6e0aeb2b5c71fb857f09feff6172c4ee7bdfae08` retains its contract. Exact
deployed-commit, capability, authorization-denial, and protected-State readbacks
pass.

Historical completion, overlap elapsed time, issue-closure notice, and the
canary's later release date remain required for full overhaul completion.

## 10. Phase 4 — launch

After the launch packet is complete:

### 10.1 Release controller

- [x] Confirm no release is currently due.
- [x] Enable the controller in a single-purpose change.
- [x] Verify configuration, protected State access, and publication posture at
      releases `7dba9bf4f78c71ff478de8c593cb41e07201c14a`; no source is
      currently due.

Automatic publication is live. Both the repository and `release-production`
environment latches read back `true`. The controller's reviewed State contract
accepts the current append-only descendant while retaining exact schema and
script tree checks; the protected-main integration, publication-disabled
write-free no-op, and enabled no-due-work pass all succeed.

### 10.2 Lifecycle APIs

- [x] Configure only backfill, repair/retraction, maintainer decisions,
      alias/rename, and one-way publication opt-in. The reverse publication
      transition must remain unavailable, disabled, and absent from
      user-facing forms and documentation.
- [x] Keep model consolidation disabled.
- [x] Verify effective public health and one non-mutating authorization denial
      against deployed submissions `6e0aeb2b5c71fb857f09feff6172c4ee7bdfae08`.
- [x] Retain a separately reversible feature flag for every enabled family and
      verify the all-false rollback; do not substitute another staging matrix
      for this production readback.

### 10.3 Intake

- [x] Enable production intake durably at launch restore
      `39b2e67f7583926a4f1d66b723b5d4cf4756dd32`; verify current deployed
      descendant `6e0aeb2b5c71fb857f09feff6172c4ee7bdfae08` retains it.
- [x] Verify the exact active version, durable state, and
      protected State coherence.
- [x] Submit one tightly controlled production canary only if it was part of
      the reviewed launch packet.
- [x] Verify archive completion, evaluation dispatch, State, and Result.
- [x] Verify the initial live leaderboard presentation shows the canary exactly
      once, keeps its source unavailable, and preserves the problem statement.
- [x] Verify release scheduling after the one-way publication opt-in. State
      `fb079f6c3b96388eebe106ea2938d0c2231694ba` records revision 1 as
      `scheduled`, due exactly `2026-11-02T03:50:01.002Z`.
- [x] Use the packet-bound visible archived problem and exact previously
      accepted Kim-owned source with a distinct canary model identity.
- [x] Submit the canary as private, verify that choice on the live problem page,
      then perform the required live proof of the visible irreversible
      publication opt-in. The same atomic State append creates its release
      schedule.
- [x] Complete the immediate leaderboard refresh and verify the scheduled
      choice, release timestamp, exact State commit, and unavailable source on
      the live page.
- [x] Keep the periodic read-only leaderboard State-drift deployment path
      active so later State-only lifecycle events cannot leave the public site
      stale indefinitely.
- [x] On success, delete the exact private canary branch and remove the private
      fixture repository from both source App selections; on failure, run the
      all-false recovery, pause publication, and retain those dependencies
      until the submission reaches a reviewed terminal state.
- [x] Before announcing the server, exercise the emergency pause against the
      exact deployed production version: disable intake and every lifecycle
      gate, remove the publication latch, and verify effective health, a
      write-free release-controller pass, and unchanged protected State.
- [x] Restore the same reviewed release, lifecycle, and intake settings as
      separate actions in that order, repeating the effective-health and
      protected-State readbacks after each action. Do not substitute the
      earlier staging rollback for this current-production proof.

### 10.4 Announcement

- [x] Publish the server entry path and four-week overlap dates.
- [x] State that issue intake remains available during the overlap.
- [x] State that any eventual issue-intake closure requires at least two weeks'
      notice.

Exit condition: the launch commit is live, new production submissions traverse
the promised lifecycle, and the system can be paused through the documented
path.

## 11. Phase 5 — four-week overlap

The overlap began `2026-09-02T06:57:10Z` and cannot end before
`2026-09-30T06:57:10Z`. The conditional issue-intake retirement target of that
same timestamp was announced at `2026-09-02T23:06:35Z`; its two-week notice
gate matures at `2026-09-16T23:06:35Z`. Retirement remains conditional on every
operational, adoption, final-corpus, and readiness gate below and must be
postponed if any is not satisfied. The canary's first automatic-release
checkpoint is `2026-11-02T03:50:01.002Z`. Full overhaul completion remains
blocked until these calendar gates and the operational checks below pass.

The repository variable `ISSUE_INTAKE_CUTOFF` is already installed and read
back as the exact announced timestamp `2026-09-30T06:57:10Z`. It has no effect
until the reviewed cutoff guard reaches protected `main`; merge that guard only
after the retained replay chains are terminal, then verify its protected-main
CI before the timestamp. Deleting the variable is the reversible incident
recovery that reopens issue intake before the form itself is retired.

- [ ] Monitor severity-high incidents and readiness failures.
- [ ] Monitor State validation, archive completion, evaluation dispatch,
      release scheduling, and automatic releases.
- [ ] At the first automatic controller cycle at or after the production
      canary's exact two-calendar-month due timestamp, verify its release task
      moves from scheduled to published, the reconstructed source commit and
      live leaderboard link agree, every submission still carrying the withheld
      choice remains unpublished, and no source or credential appears in public
      logs or artifacts. Pause publication on any mismatch; the final audit
      cannot complete before this checkpoint passes.
- [ ] Monitor submitter adoption of the new path.
- [ ] Keep issue intake available.
- [ ] Pause server intake if confidentiality, State consistency, or release
      safety fails.
- [ ] Extend the overlap rather than closing on schedule if a serious incident
      or inadequate adoption remains.
- [ ] Maintain the final append-only Results delta for issue submissions.

Do not turn monitoring output into a permanent incident-history appendix.

## 12. Phase 6 — historical completion

Historical lanes can run in parallel with the overlap.

Old issue intake remains live during the overlap and can append Results-only
commits to submissions `main`. Process the retained baseline now using immutable
dispatch tags; do not demand a quiet protected branch. Maintain an append-only
delta, and treat only the announced issue-intake cutoff as the final corpus.

### 12.1 Final inventory

- [ ] Only after every issue-retirement gate except the final-cutoff/delta
      readback is satisfied, disable new issue-intake acceptance at the
      announced exact UTC cutoff in a single-purpose freeze. Drain every run
      accepted before the cutoff, then freeze the final Results head and
      corpus. Keep final form removal blocked until the delta is recorded and
      the retirement packet passes; do not compute a nominally final delta
      while issue intake can still add a Result.
- [ ] Generate and validate the append-only inventory delta.
- [ ] Reconcile public, private, and unavailable counts against every accepted
      Result.
- [ ] Ensure no accepted Result disappears or changes identity.

### 12.2 Public source

The source-evidence snapshot
`evidence/historical-public-replay-github-evidence-current.json` at
`lean-eval-submissions@674ab422f1d9adcf7108f8ea1ff623b37c59409b`, with SHA-256 digest
`7c10dfc3e3d66f6f9ae0107ef2ed94b8f731d7f8410741ed3f5978dc55e149e5`.
It is not the retained-baseline or current-corpus count: its 636 Results include
three post-baseline public Results. It covers 318 requests: 123 are resolved and
195 are classified source-unavailable, with no ambiguous, missing,
indeterminate, or unreviewed classification. The retained-baseline public
partition is exactly 633 Results: 174 replay tasks and 459 reviewed unavailable
dispositions.
Protected production State ancestor
`07e68200ee20efdd363cea16c1d08a13971acc2e` introduced those dispositions.
Retained-baseline checkpoint
`76b3b3e54f4be69161a00cd81576a58df8eae815` validates them and the complete
retained replay queues with no missing or extra Result identity. Later
append-only State commits do not replace this retained checkpoint.

- [x] Retain the retained-baseline canonical public replay plan and exact toolchain/source
      mappings.
- [x] Review each retained-baseline `source_unavailable` classification for its terminal State
      disposition.
- [x] Build/qualify only images used by replayable results.
- [x] Qualify the final missing image from the retained baseline plan in an
      isolated replay-disabled Worker.
- [x] Commit and validate its generated qualification profile. All 35 retained
      public profiles are frozen at
      `lean-eval-submissions@81e94fe2f4fc819300fd7d4e036f00124166784f`.

### 12.3 Private archives

The canonical retained-baseline crosswalk accounts for 639 bound Results and
29 archive-not-found dispositions. The retained private-image set contains 63
canonical profiles and accounts for all 639 qualified Results, with none
pending.

The retained-baseline archive migration is complete. All 439 recoverable
archives received bound schema-version-3 envelopes without changing archive
ciphertext or stable identities. The exact reviewed patch was promoted to
audit `main` at `d73132415738b0d82c99fd43f630804fe996e342`.
Post-promotion readback passed, the review branch and transient installed
identity were removed, and the protected migration environment no longer
contains `LEGACY_ARCHIVE_IDENTITY`. Keep the retained offline legacy key until
the final issue-intake delta has been migrated and its recovery checks pass.

- [x] Reconcile exact archive/result bindings and explicit orphans.
- [x] Apply and read back the dedicated Encrypt-only migration role, exact OIDC
      trust, protected environment binding, and unchanged ordinary AWS roles.
- [x] Build, publish by immutable digest, and inspect only the exact private
      replay images used by the retained baseline inventory.
- [x] Retire the synthetic private-image qualifier and its bounded-wave
      controller; do not replace them with another qualification service.
- [x] Complete the static pre-mutation portion of one immutable retained-baseline
      historical migration/replay packet. Bind exact public/private profile and
      task-content hashes and counts, rewrap inventory, workflow commit and
      digest, migration role and trust, controller leases and scopes, rollback,
      and exclusions. It must exclude legacy-key destruction, the final intake
      delta, new external actions, and every item absent from those hashes.
- [x] Bind the rewrap to that exact reviewed pre-mutation packet before
      installing the legacy identity or writing canonical archive envelopes.
      Standing authorization satisfies permission but not this packet gate.
- [x] Install `LEGACY_ARCHIVE_IDENTITY` only for the bounded packet-bound run.
- [x] Rewrap recoverable archives without changing ciphertext archive bytes or
      stable IDs.
- [x] Complete the post-migration readback in the same packet. Bind the
      randomized sidecar tree, deterministic report hash, exact staged patch,
      and then-current audit `main`. Require the pinned source to remain an
      ancestor, zero overlap between intervening changes and migration-touched
      paths, and promotion of exactly that patch onto the current head. Bind
      the resulting commit and tree, zero ciphertext changes, credential
      cleanup, exact current State head, State event IDs and digests,
      materialized queue hashes and counts, and redacted projection before
      writing production State or enabling replay.
- [x] Install the reviewed audit promotion contract, bind its caller, and
      retire the bootstrap path. Require each exact migration promotion to
      delete its `archive-file-key-rewrap-v1` review branch.
- [x] Remove the transient installed identity and migration scratch output;
      retain only the authority and offline legacy-key copies required for the
      final delta.
- [ ] Keep every legacy identity copy until the final issue-intake delta is
      closed; destroy it only after the documented cutoff, reconciliation, and
      recovery checks are complete.

### 12.4 Replay

The replay credential and bounded public/private two-lane controller are
installed. Retained-baseline State binding
`e2b95a76d5d854f27d95358a2aafd380a40acc8445c3ab13ae7621614ce8d31f`
was generated by submissions implementation
`d8834749c3f21f14d5d42ad259cc67a687417ea9`, protected at checkpoint
`36e405e558be69d50e3093d3e188d24d6fc7cfa1`, and promoted exactly as State
checkpoint `76b3b3e54f4be69161a00cd81576a58df8eae815` (tree
`e196521b812a0942eea9d11a8bcb2d7569728d50`). It contributes 2,439 lifecycle
events and 813 deterministic replay tasks: 174 public and 639 private. The
retained public unavailable set is 459 Results and the private unavailable set
is 29 Results. All 439 recoverable private archives are migrated. The fixed
review branch is absent and State validation passes.

The exact post-repair private replay canary is terminal accepted. Its terminal
State, artifact, credential cleanup, and executor-absence readbacks pass.
Retained terminal accounting includes accepted and safely failed executions.

The post-launch replay packet is protected at submissions
`d26a3090a338358915cc94651ec7efddde71d241` and binds controller source
`6e0aeb2b5c71fb857f09feff6172c4ee7bdfae08`. Activation State checkpoint
`4fae55f7699e80d5b50314cf678bcf6caa020ad8` materialized 161 public and 630
private queued entries. The first public sustained task is terminal accepted
and exactly one successor continues that chain. Private non-replenishing proof
run `33823645564` is terminal accepted at State
`24bcb65c8849b95f569c8ee037503049c7fe568f`, with its redacted artifact and
resource/credential cleanup reviewed. Sustained private run `33826897577` is
active on the same exact baseline. Both controller variables are installed; a
future safe stop deletes the relevant lane variable first, before any other
recovery action.

- [x] Install the production replay credential without exposing its value.
- [x] Merge and deploy the bounded public/private two-lane controller in the
      current submissions runtime.
- [x] Stage and validate the retained-baseline State events without changing
      protected production State or enabling either replay lane.
- [x] Promote exactly the validated State baseline, verify the protected head
      and materialized public/private queues, and only then enable replay.
- [x] Complete the exact-current private retained-baseline replay canary and
      its terminal readback before expanding either controller lane.
- [x] Remove the obsolete staging smoke machinery.
- [ ] Merge the bounded final-delta activation and closure mechanism after the
      retained drain. Merge its audit companion first, then rebind the
      submissions implementation to the resulting exact protected audit head
      and tree before final review.
- [x] Refresh the exact operational documentation and finish the final current
      submissions deployment before starting the retained drain.
- [x] Bind the post-launch replay packet to the exact deployed implementation
      and current protected State before reinstalling either controller
      variable.
- [x] Start exactly one bounded public controller and one non-replenishing
      private proof concurrently under their independent leases and concurrency
      groups.
- [x] After the private proof reaches a reviewed terminal state, start its
      bounded sustained lane.
- [ ] Drain both queues. Use another dispatch only for bounded retries left by
      those runs.
- [ ] Append canonical dispositions only within
      the exact retained-baseline packet completed in section 12.3. After the
      announced cutoff, process the append-only final delta through a separate
      exact packet; extending the baseline packet by implication is forbidden.
- [ ] Restore exact original source, benchmark, toolchain, comparator,
      lean4export, and nanoda pins.
- [ ] Execute the official Lean kernel path and nanoda only.
- [ ] Record terminal outcomes with bounded retries.
- [ ] Publish redacted verdicts and measurements.
- [ ] Confirm every final-cutoff Result has a replay or reviewed unavailable
      disposition.

No experimental checker or promotion work may be added to close this phase.

### 12.5 Retire migration-only authority

Do this only after the final-delta migration is promoted, every final-cutoff
Result is terminal, the legacy identity is absent, both replay controllers are
disabled, and no migration or replay run or temporary executor remains.

- [ ] Merge current-head single-purpose retirement changes that remove the
      migration dispatch, custodian helper and setup path, audit
      promotion/bootstrap machinery, and temporary private-replay machinery.
      Keep schema-version-3 archives and the ordinary v2 unwrap/replay path.
- [ ] Verify no migration or replay run is active, bind the last possible role
      session issuance time, wait through the role's maximum session duration,
      and reverify that no live session or executor remains.
- [ ] Apply and read back the exact infrastructure retirement that removes only
      the migration Encrypt role and its stack output. Preserve ordinary
      archive, replay, and release roles and the v1+v2 Decrypt support needed by
      retained archives.
- [ ] Delete the migration GitHub environment and its variables/secrets, and
      delete the migration-only audit deploy key. Verify both are absent and
      that unrelated credentials and environments are unchanged.
- [ ] Verify that no bootstrap, source, or promotion review branch remains.
      After final infrastructure and credential retirement, destroy the
      custodian's offline legacy-key master and verify that no installed or
      working copy remains.

## 13. Phase 7 — remaining product completion

### 13.1 Open problems

- [x] Add or verify the neutral open-problems tab.
- [x] Confirm the empty state is clear and visually intentional.
- [x] Confirm it has no FC branding, importer, synchronization, or disproof
      dependency.

### 13.2 Software verification and editorial state

- [x] Verify both reviewed software-verification drafts render correctly.
- [x] Verify provisional/draft policy text.
- [x] Complete the maintainer-selected human statement/citation review.
- [x] Confirm no agent-authored hints were introduced.
- [x] Leave verified-calculation runner infrastructure unimplemented.

### 13.3 Final leaderboard readback

- [x] Confirm lifecycle, stable problem URLs, statements, unique and total
      standings, recent solutions, and metadata provenance are presented.
- [ ] Confirm one live automatic released-solution link and representative
      historical replay measurements after those operational lanes complete.
      No further repository feature work is pending for this surface.

### 13.4 Retire issue intake

- [ ] Confirm at least four weeks of announced overlap.
- [ ] Confirm at least two weeks of closure notice.
- [ ] Confirm no unresolved severity-high incident.
- [ ] Confirm adequate adoption and stable end-to-end operation.
- [ ] Confirm the final historical cutoff/delta is recorded.
- [ ] Confirm the cutoff freeze stopped accepting new issue work before the
      final Results head was frozen and every pre-cutoff run drained. Keep the
      public issue form frozen but present until the retirement packet passes.
- [ ] Complete the issue-retirement readiness packet because this removes the
      path used by existing issue-intake users. Standing authorization covers
      closure only after every preceding gate is satisfied.
- [ ] Close issue intake in a single-purpose repository change.
- [ ] Verify the server path remains available and documented.

## 14. Final audit and definition of done

- [ ] Check every completion criterion in completion-plan section 13.
- [ ] Search every allowlisted repository for stale FC, disproof,
      experimental-kernel, model-consolidation-launch, and persistent-harness
      instructions.
- [ ] Confirm remaining mentions are historical context or explicit exclusions,
      not TODOs.
- [ ] Confirm current infrastructure and rollback documents contain current
      facts only.
- [ ] Confirm no unexplained open overhaul PR, active workflow, or local-only
      required change remains.
- [ ] Run final repository validation with no errors or linter warnings.
- [ ] Mark this runbook complete and summarize current operation and ordinary
      maintenance ownership.

Production launch restore `39b2e67f7583926a4f1d66b723b5d4cf4756dd32`
is live through deployed descendant
`6e0aeb2b5c71fb857f09feff6172c4ee7bdfae08` with durable intake. Full
completion is deliberately calendar-bound and occurs only when every
completion-plan criterion is actually satisfied.
